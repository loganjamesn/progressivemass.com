# Progressive Massachusetts #

As an exercise, I am redesigning and building a new WordPress website for Progressive Massachusetts (https://www.progressivemass.com/) as their current site is dated and not responsive. If I'm happy with the result, I'll reach out to them with my ideas and see if they'd like to work together to update their online presence!
